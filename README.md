# Gocache
A simple go based caching server. Mainly created as a learning experience but can also be used as a lightweight stand-in redis server.

The project idea came from [build-your-own-x](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x). There I followed [Build Redis from scratch](https://www.build-redis-from-scratch.dev/en/introduction).

## What Gocache can do
Can run as an external service or as an in-memory caching provider. Underneath, like redis, its a simple key-value store.

## Developing
